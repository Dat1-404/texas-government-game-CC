# Texas Government Game
This game is a text adventure/terminal game.
That means that the game is played in a terminal or command line (cmd).
To run the game, make sure you have Python installed.
To check if you have Python installed, simply go into your command prompt and enter the command "python --version".
You can install it on the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You can also run the project on the project's [repl.it page](https://replit.com/@Dat1Programmer/Texas-Government-Game-CC-7th?v=1).
There is also a Windows-only exe file in the Releases, which doesn't require you to install Python.

## How to play

This game is a terminal game. You usually navigate by pressing ENTER, and when you are prompted with a choice, respond with the corresponding number. Sometimes, there are animaions, and you do not need to press enter during these animations.
